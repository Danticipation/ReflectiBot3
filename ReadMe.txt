## üìÅ Project Structure

```
/server
  /src
    /controllers     # Route logic and request handling
    /routes          # Route definitions
    /services        # Business logic (e.g. style, memory, DB)
    /utils           # Helpers (prompt generation, formatting)
    /storage.ts      # DB abstraction
    index.ts         # Server entry point
```

## üß† Architecture Philosophy

- **Controllers**: Pure logic for handling requests and responses
- **Routes**: Mountable Express routers for clean separation
- **Services**: Reusable business logic (e.g. personality reflection)
- **Storage**: Single interface for DB calls
- **Utils**: Helper logic and prompt generators

---

## üõ† Setup & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## ‚ú® Contributing
- Add routes to `/routes/<name>.ts`
- Place logic in `/controllers/<name>Controller.ts`
- Use service files for shared AI logic

---

## üîí Secrets
Set the following environment variables:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-key
```

---

## üöß Roadmap
- [ ] Add unit tests for controllers
- [ ] Add Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- [ ] Add persistent user memory
- [ ] Deploy to production
